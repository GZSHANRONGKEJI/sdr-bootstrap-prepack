# Spring Data REST Bootstrap prepack

This repo is a [Structor](https://github.com/ipselon/structor) starter project for [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) Web application with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) UI. 

### What can be built with this project?

Choosing this project as a starter project you can easily build a Web application for database CRUD operations with REST interface, authentication, and dynamic and good looking Web UI. 

Here you will find a wide range (which is getting wider day by day) of the components for sophisticated Web UI:
  * Data Grid components with sorting, paging, editing and deleting capabilities,
  * List components for collections,
  * Form components for adding, editing records in collections,
  * Form components for filtering data in collections,
  * Pagination components for the navigation though pages in Data Grids,
  * and others.

In contrast to majority of the Web apps for database CRUD operations, UI components of the project can display linked entities collections, interact with each other, can search data, has different types of input elements including dropdowns, date calendars and others.

All tools and libraries of this project are neatly configured and works perfect with each other, also you will find here a very simple building process of the whole application.

It's worth a mention that all components are created and manipulated by a visual builder, which gives an instant feedback about how components look and feel.
